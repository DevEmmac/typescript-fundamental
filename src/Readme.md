* Dynamic typing and Static typing also knows as dynamically typed and statically typed.

### Dynamically typed: means the type of variables can be change at runtime

2. Statically typed: means the type of variables that cannot change once its declared.

# Advantage of dynamically typed
1. In dynamically typed language, type errors are only dicovered at runtime, which can lead to unecpected crashes and bugs.

# Advantage of statically typed
1. statically typed language promotes type safety and detects errors at an early stage.


* (Go is a language that's statically typed.)

* (Interpreter reads code and translates it line by line into what's known as machine code or byte code.)

(Compiler catches type-related errors before the program runs, leading to more reliable code.)
